/**
 * FileIconProvider provides a standard interface for retrieving file icons. Icon providers can fetch icons from any
 * type of source, whether they be some API or a set of icon images. There is no requirement on the resolution in which
 * the icons are provided, nor on the set of file criteria used to select the icon (file kind, name, size, ...).
 * Implementations should however be able to return icons for any type of {@link AbstractFile}.
 * The specialized {@link com.mucommander.commons.file.icon.LocalFileIconProvider} class can come in handy for icon sources
 * that can only cope with local files.

     * <p>The specified <code>Dimension</code> is used as a hint at the preferred icon's resolution; there is
     * absolutely no guarantee that the returned <code>Icon</code> will indeed have this resolution. This dimension is

     * The implementation is not expected to perform any rescaling (either up or down), this method should only return
     * icons in their 'native' resolutions, using the preferred resolution to choose between different native dimensions.
     * For example, if this provider is able to create icons both in 16x16 and 32x32 resolutions, and a 48x48 resolution
     * is preferred, the 32x32 resolution should be favored as it is closer to 32x32.
