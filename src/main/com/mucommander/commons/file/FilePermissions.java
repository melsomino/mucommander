/**
 * FilePermissions is an interface that represents the permissions of an {@link com.mucommander.commons.file.AbstractFile}.
 * The actual permission values can be retrieved by the methods inherited from the
 * {@link com.mucommander.commons.file.PermissionBits} interface. The permissions mask returned by {@link #getMask()} allows
 * to determine which permission bits are significant, i.e. should be taken into account. That way, certain
 * {@link AbstractFile} implementations that have limited permissions support can set those supported permission bits
 * while making it clear that other bits should be ignored, and not simply be considered as being disabled.
 * For instance, a file implementation with support for the sole 'user' permissions (read/write/execute) will return a
 * mask whose int value is 448 (700 octal).
 *
 * <p>This interface also defines constants for commonly used file permissions.
